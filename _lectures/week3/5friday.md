# About Breadth/Depth

Each Friday morning (except for week 5), we have a special lecture
section called "breadth/depth".  The depth lecture is scheduled to be in Room 2154 and the breadth lecture is in Room 4258. 


* If you feel that you would benefit from reviewing and going into more
depth about the material from the previous week to solidify your
understanding, choose depth. Documents for depth can be found [here](/lectures/week3/depth/)

* If you are confident in your mastery of the content from the previous
week, and would like to learn about something different, choose the
breadth lecture. Breadth lecture can be found [here](/lectures/week3/breadth/)
