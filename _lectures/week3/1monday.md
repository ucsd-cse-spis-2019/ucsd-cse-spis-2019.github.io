# FOCS 8:45am - 10:00am (Curt)

Lecture slides: [Image processing - advanced topics](/lectures/week3/SPIS Lecture 19 - Images Advanced.pdf)

Code from lecture on HSV conversion. This is useful for the greenscreen substitution challenge in lab05. [HSV to RGB conversion](/lectures/week3/hsv.py)

Here is information for the challenge of combining image processing and recursion. First create the two helper functions as described in these slides (insert and scale). One of them (scale) you already created as part of lab05 and the other (insert) is very similar to one. Now, create three additional functions that use these two helper functions. The first should simply insert a scaled version of a picture into itself (in the upper left quadrant). The second should do this recursively up to a certain number of levels. And the third should rotate through the quadrants in which this happens, again using recursion. For examples and more information ,see: [Combining image processing and recursion](/lectures/week3/SPIS Lecture 19 - Image recursion challenges.pdf)
