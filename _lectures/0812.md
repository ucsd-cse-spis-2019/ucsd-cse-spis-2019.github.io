# About Breadth/Depth

Each Friday morning (except for week 5), we have a special lecture
section called "breadth/depth".   

* If you feel that you would benefit from reviewing and going into more
depth about the material from the previous week to solidify your
understanding, choose [depth](depth).

* If you are confident in your mastery of the content from the previous
week, and would like to learn about something different, choose the
[breadth](breadth) lecture.
