There are several different scenarios for creating a github repo that you may need to use during SPIS.

This page contains an outline of several of these.

* [Method 1]({{site.url}}/topics/github_create_repo#method1){:data-ajax="false" }: Create empty private repo for a lab, optionally adding starter code from a link
* [Method 2]({{site.url}}/topics/github_create_repo#method2){:data-ajax="false" }: Create private repo for a lab, with README.md and Python .gitignore
* [Method 3](/topics/github_aps_writeups/) Create private repo for APS writeups

* [Github: Setup](/topics/github_setup/)
* [Github: Introduction](/topics/github_introduction/)

# <a name="method1"></a>Method 1: Create empty private repo, optionally adding starter code from a link

We ask that you create a new private github repo *inside the
ucsd-cse-spis-2019 organization* for each lab assignment.  You and
your partner will share the same repo by following these instructions

1. Navigate to 
   the [ucsd-cse-spis-2019 organization](https://github.com/ucsd-cse-spis-2019)

1. Click on the "New repository" button to create a new repo as shown below (note that the github layout has changed somewhat; look for a green "New" button instead of the "New respository" button as show in the screenshot.  Also, these screenshots are from 2016.
   Your screens should show 2019, of course.): 

   ![new repo](/images/new-repo-begin.png)
   
   Be sure that the "owner" of the repository is *ucsd-cse-spis-2019*
   as shown in the image, and NOT your own github account.  If the
   owner shows as your own github id, you may have to change the pull
   down menu on the left where it says owner.
   
   When creating your repo use the naming convention
   `spis19-labXX-<pair name>`. Enter your pair name exactly as listed
   under the `Pair_Name` column [at this
   link](http://ucsd-cse-spis-2019.github.io/info/pairs/). For
   example, if you are creating a repo for lab04, and the name of your
   pair is Phill-Diba, then your repo should be named
   "spis19-lab04-Phill-Diba". Select the "private" option when
   creating your repo to make sure your repo is only visible to the
   collaborators of the repo (you and your partner) and the course
   instructors. Click on the "Create repository" button. See the
   screenshot below:

3. After you click "Create Repository", you'll see the following screen.
   For some labs we have provided you with some starter code. To obtain
    the starter code, click on the "import code" button on the screen that
    follows right after you create a new repo. Then provide the url of the
    repository that contains the starter code. This url should be
    specified in the assignment writeup. The screenshot below shows what
    you should expect to see if you were importing the starter code for
    lab04:
	
    ![click import code](/images/import-code1.png)

4.  After you click  the *import code* button,
    a screen will come up similar to the one below.    You should have been
    given the URL of a repo for your *starter code*.   Copy and paste that URL
    into the box labelled "Your old repository's clone URL".    Then click
    the button labeled "begin import".

5. Its now time to clone a copy of your repo on the computer where you
    intend to work. We strongly recommend that you create this clone on one
    of the ieng6 servers (e.g. ieng6-240.ucsd.edu). The process of
    creating a copy of your repo is called cloning because you not only
    get a replica of your code on a difference machine but can reflect
    changes made in one clone repo to any other clone using the mechanisms
    that Git provides. This is a key feature that essentially allows you
    to work on the same version of your code from any computer. 

    For now,
    we are interested in working on the `ieng6` servers, so that's where you
    will create the clone. To clone your repo navigate to your repo on
    github and click on the green "clone or download" button on the top
    right corner. 

    Clicking on this link gives you either an ssh or https
    address that you will need in the cloning process clone. Copy the ssh
    address that starts with a `git@`. See the screenshot below:
	
    ![new repo](/images/get-repo-url.png) 
    
    Log into your account on ieng6 and clone your newly created repo
    using the `git clone` command as in the following example:

    ```
    $ git clone git@github.com:ucsd-cse-spis-2019/spis19-lab04-Phill-Diba.git

    ```
    
    Make sure you provide the address to your repo instead of the one
    provided above. To check if your repo has been cloned correctly, type
    `ls` on the command prompt and you should see a directory with your
    repo name. Navigate into that directory using the `cd` command. For
    example if the directory name is `spis19-lab04-Phill-Diba`, at the
    command prompt type `cd spis19-lab04-Phill-Diba`


## Submitting your code via github

We recommend that you keep your repo on the git server up to date with
the latest version of your code. This allows your mentor to give you
timely feedback as you progress through the assignments. To do this
follow these steps:

1.  Stage all the files that have changed using the command

    ```
    git add file1.py file2.py ... filen.py
    ```

2.  Commit your changes using the command `git commit -m "message"`

    `"message"` should be a descriptive message about your commit.   

3.  Push your changes to github by typing the command

    ```
    git push origin master
    ```

    Your changes will not be visible to your mentor unless you do this final
    step.


# <a name="method2"></a>Method 2: Create private repo for a lab with README.md and Python .gitignore

Sometimes when creating a repo from scratch for a lab, we want to set it up with a README.md and a .gitignore
for Python, right from the start.   The following diagram illustrates the steps involved.

You create a repo by selecting the small + sign with the triangle at the upper left corner of the github.com page, 
or simply by logging into github, then navigating to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)

Then you see this screen, where you fill in the values as shown.
