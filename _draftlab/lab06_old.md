# What you'll do in this lab

This lab is intended to be an opportunity to review, reinforce, and build your confidence with basic programming
skills.

Before we move into more advanced labs and projects, we want to give you an opportunity to be sure that your
understanding of the following is solid.

* Simple python functions
* Working with if/else
* Working with types in Python
* Python Strings
* Loops
* Recursion

So, we've set up a series of files that contain stubs for various Python functions, along with
tests for those functions.

Your job is very simple: see if you replace each of the stubs with code that passes the tests that go along with that
file.

When you are finished, you can submit your solution to Gradescope for automatic "grading".  (Keep in mind that in SPIS, 
all so-called "grades" are just a way to get feedback on how you are doing.  They don't "count" on your permanent record in any way.  Treat them as "practice" grades.)

# Overview 

The basic structure of the lab is similar to [lab02](/lab02), except for the one-time steps from that lab, and the 
fact that the repo you create will begin with some starter code (similar to lab04)

After creating the repo, you'll `git clone ... ` the repo, and then start editing Python code, trying to get
test cases to pass.

Each time you get one more test case to pass, or each time you need to take a break from coding, be sure to do the
`git add file.py ; git commit -m "AB/CD message"; git push origin master` steps.   

The instructions below will give you some additional hints about each of the functions that you'll be writing,
including hints, references to help articles on the website, and/or suggestions of relevant passages in the text.

When all done, and all test cases are passing, you'll download your project as a `.zip` file and submit to
Gradescope for automatic checking of all your test cases.

Ok, let's get started!

# Step-by-Step Instructions

# Step 1: Create your repository.

For this lab, we have made starter code available for you. Following the same procedure we had for lab04, you'll set up the repo with [Method 1](/topics/github_create_repo/#method1){: data-ajax="false"},
importing the starter code from this link:  [{{ page.starter-code-url }}]({{ page.starter-code-url }})

The name of your repo should be `spis19-`<tt>{{page.num}}</tt>`-Name1-Name2`, as before. And invite your pair partner to be a collaborator with admin access. 


# Step 2: Python coding.

In this step you will work, one file at a time, trying to replace the function stubs in each file with running code.

The process consists of:

* choosing a Python file to work on, e.g `pyfuncs01.py`
* running its tests e.g. `test_pyfuncs01.py`
* seeing the tests fail
* then replacing the stubs in `pyfuncs01.py` with correct code so 
    that the tests pass
* doing the git workflow to commit your changes, e.g. for `pyfuncs01.py`:
    * `git status`
    * `git add pyfuncs01.py`
    * `git status`
    * `git commit -m "AT/CL tests passing for pyfuncs01.py`
    * `git status`
    * `git push origin master`
    * `git status`
    
You'll repeat this process for each of the files pyfuncs01.py,
pyfuncs02.py, etc.

* As a reminder, the `CL/AT` is used to indicate that you were working as a pair, with:
    * `CL` (Chris La Jolla) driving (driver's initials first)
    * `AT` (Alex Triton) navigating (navigator's initials second).
    * Of course, you should use your own pair's initials, not `CL/AT`
    
* When you have *all* the tests passing,<br> do one more commit with
    the commit message `"CL/AT all tests passing"`.

For each, there some additional hints below.

## `pyfuncs01.py`: Simple Python functions

In pyfuncs01.py, we have two simple python functions that just return a value based on their parameters.

Load the file `pyfuncs01.py` and the file `test_pyfuncs01.py` into IDLE.

You'll need to edit and save changes to both of these files, but its the 
file `test_pyfuncs01.py` that you need to run to see if the test cases pass.

Here, you are just calculating a result by using the arithmetic operators (such as `+`,`-`,`*`,`/`,`**`,`%` etc.) and returning it.  

You are also asked to add a few test cases for one of the functions
in `test_pyfuncs01.py`.


## `pyfuncs02.py`: Checking types

For this step, you should open the files `pyfuncs02.py`, and
`test_pyfuncs02.py`.   

(This pattern repeats itself for each of the remaining files
`pyfuncs03.py`, `pyfuncs04.py`, and `pyfuncs05.py`; each one has a
test file starting with `test_` that goes along with it.  So we won't
repeat those instructions for each step below.)

These functions return True or False based on whether their parameter is of a certain type.

You can read more about types in Python here: [Python: types](/topics/python_types/)

You are given one example of a function that checks for type, and you are asked to write another one.

You are also asked to write some test cases for a function.  Note that if you don't write those test cases, your
`test_pyfuncs02.py` may appear to pass even when you haven't yet replaced the stub for one of the functions
you are supposed to write.

# `pyfuncs03.py`: boolean functions involving `or`

In this file, you are given a correct function definition for
`isAdditivePrimaryColor` as an example.   There is a comment that invites
you to try a different way of writing the function: one that many students
sometimes think will work, but that doesn't.  You are encouraged to read
the comment, and experiment with that function a bit to convince yourself
that the "alternative" way of writing it doesn't work, and to try to understand
why.

Then you are asked to write a correct implementation of the function
`isSimpleNumeric`.   You can use the function `isAdditivePrimaryColor` as
an example.  You may also want to consult the functions from `pyfuncs02.py`
as a reminder of how to check for types. 

As a reminder, run `test_pyfuncs03.py` to test the functions in this
file.    You actually can run these tests from the Unix command line too,
by typing `python test_pyfuncs03.py`&mdash;you don't actually have to open
up `test_pyfuncs03.py` in IDLE, since you don't have to make any changes to 
it.  

# `pyfuncs04.py`: `first`, `rest`, `last`, `allButLast` functions for lists and tuples

These functions are based on the idea of indexing into lists and tuples with 
notations such as `[0]`, `[1:]`, and so forth.

You may want to review the sections of Chapter 5 of your book. You are given two function
definitions as examples, and then asked to replace the stubs for two more.

# `pyfuncs05.py`: Recursion on lists and tuples

The final set of functions uses the `first` and `rest` functions to 
do some calculations on lists, via recursion.  This is a nice opportunity to 
check your understanding of recursion, and practice more with the idea.

Try to understand how the `totalValue` function works to add up all the number
in a list or tuple of numeric values. Then see if you can apply those ideas to write similar definition for `productOfAll`, using recursion in a similar fashion.

Next, you are asked to write two simple functions: `isOdd` and `isEven`.
Those don't involve recursion or lists; but the `isOdd` function is used
as a helper function in two more functions in `pyfuncs05.py` that do
involve recursion.

Once you've written those and gotten the test cases to pass, 
try to understand how the `countOdds` function works.
Then see if you can apply those ideas to write 
 `sumOdds`, using a similar recursive technique.

If you got all those tests to pass, you are pretty much done.  Just
a few steps to finish up and submit.

# Step 7: Final check of all your tests

As one last check, run all of your tests in IDLE, or at the command line.

Here is an example of running each one of your tests at the command line.  Here the bash shell prompt is replaced by simply `$ ` to make the output easier to read.    If your output looks like this, it means all of your tests are passing.

```
