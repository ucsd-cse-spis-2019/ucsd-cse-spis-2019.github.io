If you find typos or problems with the lab instructions, please report them on Piazza.

# Technical Glitches

Everything should be working now with Heroku and ACMS! If you run into any problems, please let a mentor or instructor know. 


# Part 1: Getting Started

Please create a private repo called `spis18-lab08-part1-Name-Name` using [Method 2](/topics/github_create_repo/)

Then clone that repo into your `~/github` directory, cd into it, and then try all the steps in this tutorial:

[Webapps Part 1, Flask, Getting Started](/webapps/webapps-intro-part-1-flask-getting-started/)


# Part 2: Working with Calculations and Templates

When you are done with that please create a **different** private repo called `spis18-lab08-part2-Name-Name` using [Method 2](/topics/github_create_repo/)

Then clone that repo into your `~/github` directory, cd into it, and then try all the steps in this tutorial:

[Webapps Part 2, Calculations and Templates](/webapps/webapps-intro-part-2/)

# Part 2.5: Creating a Navigation Bar

Using the repo from Part 2, follow the steps in this tutorial:

[Webapps Part 2.5, Nav Bar](/webapps/webapps-intro-part-2-5/)

# Part 3: Getting Started with Heroku

Next, try all of the steps in the following tutorial, where you'll set up a Heroku account, and create a
sample web app on Heroku.

# Part 4: Converting an existing Flask app to use Heroku

For the final part of this lab, please try following the steps in the tutorial below (part 4) to convert both of the web 
apps you already created, i.e.  `spis18-lab08-part1-Name-Name` and `spis18-lab08-part1-Name-Name` to run on Heroku:

Add a link in the README.md of each of your github repos to the address of the running app on Heroku.

# Part 5: Working with Sessions in Flask

Read this short write-up on working with the idea of sessions. Click the link to the web app hosted on Heroku and have each partner try the form out. Next, go through the files on Github and see if you and your partner understands how all the pieces fit together. This part of the lab does not require any additional code to your Lab 08 repositories.

When you've done that, you are finished with lab08---let your mentor know and ask them for some feedback.
