# Part 4: Converting an existing Flask app to use Heroku

For the final part of this lab, please try following the steps in the tutorial below (part 4) to convert both of the web

Add a link in the README.md of each of your github repos to the address of the running app on Heroku.

When you've done that, you are finished with lab07---let your mentor know and ask them for some feedback.
