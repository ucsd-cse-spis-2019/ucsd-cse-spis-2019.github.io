# Enrichment Videos

The enrichment videos this week introduce you to two women who made big contributions to the history of computing.  Watch these two videos:

* [Great Minds: Katherine Johnson](https://youtu.be/Bdr9QBRcPEk)
* [Great Minds: Margaret Hamilton](https://youtu.be/PPLDZMjgaf8)

Then do some research to find another person from history who had an influence in computing in any way (large or small), who is of interest to you.  Find a website and/or video that talks about that person to learn a bit about them and their influence in computing.

Finally, enter your responses to the questions in [this Google form](https://forms.gle/vWjvb3T7QsuRnBYTA).
