Here is how you set up the GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET credentials that you need when using Github as an OAuth provider.

# Navigate to the Developer Settings, OAuth Applications

To get there:

|  Step | What it looks like |
|-------|--------------------|
| 1. Choose Settings from upper right drop down menu next to your personal avatar | ![choose settings menu](oauth/choose_settings_menu.png) |
| 2. Find the Developer Menu, which is pretty far down the page on the left hand side.  Find OAuth Applications on that menu | ![choose OAUTH applications from developer menu](oauth/choose_developer_oauth_applications.png) |
