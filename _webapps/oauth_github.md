Here is how you set up the GITHUB_CLIENT_ID and GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET credentials that you need when using Github as an OAuth provider.

# Navigate to the Developer Settings, OAuth Applications

To get there:

1. Choose Settings from upper right drop down menu next to your personal avatar 
2. Find the Developer Menu, which is pretty far down the page on the left hand side. Find OAuth Apps on that menu.
3. Click the "Register a New Application" button.
