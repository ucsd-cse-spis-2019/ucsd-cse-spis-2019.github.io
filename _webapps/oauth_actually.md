This tutorial assumes that you have already:

1. Understood how to work with sessions, as described here: [Sessions](/webapps/sessions/)
1. Read through the introductory material on OAuth here: [OAuth (introduction)](/webapps/oauth/)

Note: this lesson is adapted from a sample webapp created by a SPIS instructor from 2016.

We're going to create a basic webapp with OAuth, step-by-step, with Github, restricting it to only the people inside the 2017 SPIS Github Organization. We're going to break down each and every part, especially the OAuth code that will be going in. First, create a repo on Github called `spis17-oauth-org-example-Name1-Name2`, add your partner, and then clone the repo into your github directory on your local workstation. Don't forget to commit when you finished implementing a feature or think it is a good place to save your work.

# Getting the right modules

First off, we need to make sure we have the necessary modules to run OAuth with Github in Python. At your workstation in terminal, run these commands one at a time: 

```
pip install --user Flask-OAuthlib
pip install --user PyGithub
```

# Templates Set-Up

Before we dive into OAuth, we need to get some other files set up. First, we're going to set up the templates that render the webpages themselves. Inside your `spis17-oauth-org-example-Name1-Name2` directory, create a `templates` folder using the mkdir command. Then, cd into it. 

Here is the code for `layout.html`. Notice the similarities and differences from the lab. We'll explain the flash_messages in a bit. 

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename='style.css') }}">
  <title>{% raw %}{% block title %}{% endblock %}{% endraw %} - My Webpage</title>


  </head>
  <body>
    {% raw %}{% include 'navbar.html' %}{% endraw %}


    <div id="content">
    <!-- Serves as placeholder for flash_messages depending on the result from Github login -->
    {% raw %}{% include 'flash_messages.html' %} {% endraw %}

  {% raw %}{% block content %}{% endblock %}{% endraw %}</div>

    <!-- jQuery (necessary for Bootstrap's JavaScript plugins) -->
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.12.4/jquery.min.js"></script>

  </body>
</html>
```


The code for `home.html` is:

```html
{% raw %}{% extends "layout.html" %}{% endraw %}

{% raw %}{% block title %}Home{% endblock %}{% endraw %}

{% raw %}{% block content %}{% endraw %}
  <h1>Home</h1>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/page1">That thing we do</a></li>
    <li><a href="/page2">The other thing</a></li>
  </ul>

<p>This is a sample application to demonstrate authenticating against github oauth,
using Flask, on Heroku.   This app restricts logins only to members of the 
github organization: {% raw %}{{ github_org }}{% endraw %} </p>

{% raw %}{% endblock %} {% endraw %}
```

Here is the code for `navbar.html`. Notice the if-statements using the Jinja2 templates. It checks whether or not the user is logged in and updates what is shown on the navigation bar accordingly. Where does logged_in get its value? It pulls session data, injected from `webapp.py` (more on that later).

```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-default">
  <div class="container-fluid">
    <!-- Brand and toggle get grouped for better mobile display -->
    <div class="navbar-header">
      <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#bs-example-navbar-collapse-1" aria-expanded="false">
        <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        <span class="icon-bar"></span>
      </button>
      <a class="navbar-brand" href="/">Home</a>
    </div>

    <!-- Collect the nav links, forms, and other content for toggling -->
    <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="bs-example-navbar-collapse-1">
      <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
        <li><a href="/page1">Page 1</a></li>
        <li><a href="/page2">Page 2</a></li>
      </ul>
      
      <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
      
   <!-- Checks if logged_in is true to display your github avatar and name -->  
   <!-- logged_in is injected from webapp.py using the token from OAuth -->
	{% raw %}{% if logged_in %}{% endraw %}

	<li><a class="navbar-brand" href="#">
	    <img src="{% raw %}{{ session['user_data']['avatar_url'] }}{% endraw %}&s=30" 
		 width="30" height="30" style="display: inline-block;" ></a></li>
	<li><p class="navbar-text">{% raw %}{{ session['user_data']['name']}}{% endraw %}</p></li>	
        <li><p class="navbar-text">Github userid: {% raw %}{{ session['user_data']['login']}}{% endraw %}</li>
	{% raw %}{% endif %}{% endraw %}
  
        <!-- Displays the correct button to log the user in or out -->
        <li>
          {% raw %}{% if logged_in %}{% endraw %}
	          <a href="/logout">Logout</a>
	        {% raw %}{% else %}{% endraw %}
	          <a href="/login">Login</a>
	        {% raw %}{% endif %} {% endraw %}
	      </li>
      </ul>
    </div><!-- /.navbar-collapse -->
  </div><!-- /.container-fluid -->
</nav>
```

Next, we'll have the code for two sample pages, `page1.html` and `page2.html`. Notice the code on `page1.html`. The `<pre>` tags indicate an area for preformatted text. If this webapp has user data from being logged in via Github and Oauth, information will be presented there. If logged out, it'll remain empty. Here is `page1.html`:

```html
{% raw %}{% extends "layout.html" %}{% endraw %}

{% raw %}{% block title %}{% endraw %}page1{% raw %}{% endblock %}{% endraw %}

{% raw %}{% block content %}{% endraw %}
  <h1>This is Page 1</h1>

  <p>Lorem ipsum sit dolor amet.</p>

<pre>
  {% raw %}{{ dump_user_data }}{% endraw %}
</pre>

{% raw %}{% endblock %}{% endraw %}
```

Here is `page2.html`:
```html
{% raw %}{% extends "layout.html" %}

{% raw %}{% block title %}{% endraw %}page1{% raw %}{% endblock %}{% endraw %}

{% raw %}{% block content %}{% endraw %}
  <h1>This is Page 2</h1>

  <p>Lorem ipsum Tritons rule!</p>
{% raw %}{% endblock %}{% endraw %}
```

Finally, we have our `flash_messages.html`. Depending on how the OAuth login went (successful, unsuccessful, etc.), we will get messages. In this sample webapp, we're going to display what those messages are onto our web page. Here is the code for `flash_messages.html`:

```html
<div class="flash-messages">
{% raw %}{% with messages = get_flashed_messages(category_filter=["message"]) %}{% endraw %}
  {% raw %}{% if messages %}{% endraw %}
    <div class="alert alert-info">
      <a href="#" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="close">&times;</a>
      
      <ul>
        {% raw %}{%- for msg in messages %}{% endraw %}
          <li>{% raw %}{{ msg }}{% endraw %}</li>
        {% raw %}{% endfor -%}{% endraw %}
      </ul>
    </div>
  {% raw %}{% endif %}{% endraw %}
{% raw %}{% endwith %}{% endraw %}

{% raw %}{% with errors = get_flashed_messages(category_filter=["error"]) %}{% endraw %}
  {% raw %}{% if errors %}{% endraw %}
    <div class="alert alert-warning">
      <a href="#" class="close" data-dismiss="alert" aria-label="close">&times;</a>
      <ul>
        {% raw %}{%- for msg in errors %}{% endraw %}
          <li>{% raw %}{{ msg }}{% endraw %}</li>
        {% raw %}{% endfor -%}{% endraw %}
      </ul>
    </div>
  {% raw %}{% endif %}{% endraw %}
{% raw %}{% endwith %}{% endraw %}
</div> <!-- End of class="flash-messages" -->
```

# Static & Style Set-Up

Next, we need to set up how the webpage elements look. Use the `cd ..` command to go up a level in your directory. You should now be back in your `spis17-oauth-org-example-Name1-Name2`. Make a directory called static, cd into it, and create a file called `style.css`. The code for this is simple:

```css
body {

}

#content {
     margin-left: 20px;
}

div.flash-messages {
  min-height: 4em;
}
```

Once you're done with this lesson, feel free to add, remove, or change values to this file to change your webapp to the way you want it to look. 

# Procfile & Requirements.txt

Remember, in order for our webapp to be hosted on Heroku, we need to create these two files. Your `Procfile` should have this line:

```
web: gunicorn webapp:app --log-file=-
```

Your `requirements.txt` should have these lines (Note the additional two lines at the bottom in this lesson): 

```
Flask==0.10.1
itsdangerous==0.24
Jinja2==2.8
MarkupSafe==0.23
Werkzeug==0.10.4
wheel==0.24.0
gunicorn==19.3.0
Flask-OAuthlib==0.9.3
PyGithub==1.26.0
```

# The fun stuff: `webapp.py` and OAuth

Now, we can *finally* dive deep into actual implementing OAuth. At the same level as your `templates` and `static` directories, create a file called `webapp.py`. We're going to add blocks of code, one block at a time. Each block of code should appear one after the other. With each block, we will go into detail with what it is doing. Do NOT copy-and-paste until you understand each step.

## Step 1

At the top of the file we should have all the right import statements so that we have the necessary modules. Some of these modules should look familiar. Some of the new lines include importing OAuth in line 3 and importing Github in line 5.

```python
from flask import Flask, redirect, url_for, session, request, jsonify
from flask_oauthlib.client import OAuth
from flask import render_template, flash, Markup

from github import Github

import pprint
import os
import sys
import traceback
```

## Step 2

As you remember from the previous lessons, there are certain variables that act as keys that need be defined for the OAuth communication between our webapp and Github to work correctly. This block of code checks if these variables have not been defined. If they have not, it raises the exception, printing a message to define the 4 variables. We will go more in depth in later steps. 

```python
class GithubOAuthVarsNotDefined(Exception):
    '''raise this if the necessary env variables are not defined '''

if os.getenv('GITHUB_CLIENT_ID') == None or \
        os.getenv('GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET') == None or \
        os.getenv('APP_SECRET_KEY') == None or \
        os.getenv('GITHUB_ORG') == None:
    raise GithubOAuthVarsNotDefined('''
      Please define environment variables:
         GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
         GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET
         GITHUB_ORG
         APP_SECRET_KEY
      ''')
```

## Step 3

The first two lines are familiar to you. We call Flask to create the app and set debug to False to ensure safety. In the next line, we set the secret key (remember from sessions?) to the value found in the environment variable called 'APP_SECRET_KEY'. Since we're hosting it on Heroku, we will set these up in the next part of this article [here](), but we'll worry about that when we finish the rest of the code. Talk to a mentor if you're wondering about how to set it up on localhost. Finally, we're going to create an OAuth object with our app.

```python
app = Flask(__name__)

app.debug = False

app.secret_key = os.environ['APP_SECRET_KEY']
oauth = OAuth(app)
```

## Step 4

Here is where we define which other service we're going to delegate logins to. In our case, it is Github. OAuth requires certain URLs so that it knows where to send the user to be able to enter their account information. This, along with other information, needs to be passed in as paramters when we create our remote app. We define where to find the values of keys and which URLs use. For example, the access_token_url for Github is https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token.

Now the application is almost ready to use OAuth. We need the tokengetter, which will be covered in the next step.

Flask-OAuth documentation can be found [here](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-OAuth/). Scroll down to the 'Defining Remote Applications' for more information specific to this block. This website is also very useful for information about OAuth with Flask in general.

```python
# This code originally from https://github.com/lepture/flask-oauthlib/blob/master/example/github.py
# Edited by P. Conrad for SPIS 2016 to add getting Client Id and Secret from
# environment variables, so that this will work on Heroku.


github = oauth.remote_app(
    'github',
    consumer_key=os.environ['GITHUB_CLIENT_ID'],
    consumer_secret=os.environ['GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET'],
    request_token_params={'scope': 'read:org'},
    base_url='https://api.github.com/',
    request_token_url=None,
    access_token_method='POST',
    access_token_url='https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token',
    authorize_url='https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize'
)
```

## Step 5

The Flask-OAuth documentation says it best: "OAuth uses a token and a secret to figure out who is connecting to the remote application. After authentication/authorization this information is passed to a function on your side and it is your responsibility to remember it." How are we going to remember it? That's right, sessions. We'll do more with this later. This function will get the token given to us after the user logs in with his or her Github account. 

```python
@github.tokengetter
def get_github_oauth_token():
    return session.get('github_token')
```

## Step 6 

Remember logged_in and all the information we were going to have updated on our web page from setting up our templates? Here is how we are going to give those variables their values. Using the token we got from a (hopefully) successful login in the previous step, logged_in will be set to True or False, depending on whether a 'github_token' is inside our session. In addition, we're also going to see which organization the user has to be in by accessing the environment variable. 

```python
@app.context_processor
def inject_logged_in():
    return dict(logged_in=('github_token' in session))

@app.context_processor
def inject_github_org():
    return dict(github_org=os.getenv('GITHUB_ORG'))
```

## Step 7

This should be a familiar step: rendering the webpages themselves. However, notice for `login()` and `logout()`, it doesn't return a render_template of a file in our templates folder. Instead, it uses our OAuth object to log in and authorize a user by first calling the url for the function `authorized()` (which we will cover in the next step). We can also pass in other parameters needed, such as telling the program to use 'https' for secure. Don't forget the `session.clear()` in `logout()` as you need to make sure each user gets their own session.

```python
@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template('home.html')

@app.route('/login')
def login():
    return github.authorize(callback=url_for('authorized', _external=True, _scheme='https'))

@app.route('/logout')
def logout():
    session.clear()
    flash('You were logged out')
    return redirect(url_for('home'))
```

## Step 8

Take note of the app.route for this function. It'll be important in the next part of this lesson when we deploy it to Heroku. `resp` is a variable that holds the message from Github after the user tries to log in. After we get this, we're going to check for several things and have error-handling so that our web app produces information for our user to act upon.

The first if-body checks if we got a response at all, generating and printing an appropriate error message with info detailing the error. 

If we did get a response, we're going to try save various information about the user in our session, saving the token, his or her login, etc. If we run into any kind of exception, we clear the session and print the appropriate error message to notify the user with information from the Exception variable, e.

If the user is able to login, we use the token we were given by Github. We have 4 different variables, each storing a particular piece of info about our user (what organization he/she is in, etc.). If at any point there is an error extracting any one of these pieces of information, our web app will notify that we were unable to connect properly with Github using this token. isMember is a boolean that checks the list of the members of the organization and sees if our user is one of them.

The next if-body checks if the isMember boolean is false, printing the appropriate error message to the user and clearing the session. Otherwise, it will notify the user that he or she has successfully logged in!

Finally, after all of that, it takes you back to the home page. 

```python
@app.route('/login/authorized')
def authorized():
    resp = github.authorized_response()

    if resp is None:
        session.clear()
        login_error_message = 'Access denied: reason=%s error=%s full=%s' % (
            request.args['error'],
            request.args['error_description'],
            pprint.pformat(request.args)
        )        
        flash(login_error_message, 'error')
        return redirect(url_for('home'))    

    try:
        session['github_token'] = (resp['access_token'], '')
        session['user_data']=github.get('user').data
        github_userid = session['user_data']['login']
        org_name = os.getenv('GITHUB_ORG')
    except Exception as e:
        session.clear()
        message = 'Unable to login: ' + str(type(e)) + str(e)
        flash(message,'error')
        return redirect(url_for('home'))
    
    try:
        g = Github(resp['access_token'])
        org = g.get_organization(org_name)
        named_user = g.get_user(github_userid)
        isMember = org.has_in_members(named_user)
    except Exception as e:
        message = 'Unable to connect to Github with accessToken: ' + resp['access_token'] + " exception info: " + str(type(e)) + str(e)
        session.clear()
        flash(message,'error')
        return redirect(url_for('home'))
    
    if not isMember:
        session.clear() # Must clear session before adding flash message
        message = 'Unable to login: ' + github_userid + ' is not a member of ' + org_name + \
          '</p><p><a href="https://github.com/logout" target="_blank">Logout of github as user:  ' + github_userid + \
          '</a></p>' 
        flash(Markup(message),'error')

    else:
        flash('You were successfully logged in')

    return redirect(url_for('home'))    
```

## Step 9

These lines of code should also look fairly familiar. We are rendering the additional pages we created in the templates folder earlier. Take note of `renderPage1()`. The `dump_user_data` from the `<pre>` tags gets defined here. It checks if we have a user logged in by checking if we have `user_data` in our session. Try out Page 1 while logged in and logged out and see how it differs! 

```python
@app.route('/page1')
def renderPage1():
    if 'user_data' in session:
        user_data_pprint = pprint.pformat(session['user_data'])
    else:
        user_data_pprint = '';
    return render_template('page1.html',dump_user_data=user_data_pprint)

@app.route('/page2')
def renderPage2():
    return render_template('page2.html')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
```
