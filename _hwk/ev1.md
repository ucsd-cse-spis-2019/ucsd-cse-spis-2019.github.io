# Enrichment Videos

Every week during SPIS we will have a video of set of videos that you will watch and reflect on.  The purpose of these videos is to provide you with a broader context for the specific technical knowledge and skills you are learning in FoCS.   We will provide links to the videos in these short homework writeups, and what you "submit" is a response to a set of short questions in a Google form, which will also be linked here in this homework.

The first assigned video gives you an overview of the field of computer science and it can be found here:
