Before you can give feedback on lab00, please create individual feedback repos, [as described here](/mentor/feedback-repo/)

Once you've done that, here are some things to check for [lab00](/lab/lab00/).

# Does the repo they created have the correct name?

The should have created a repo with the name listed in this spreadsheet (private to mentors only):

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YPx3YtYVFCgCFAZU7wqZBAS7n2UUHhbc2J8odHyoQZk/edit?usp=sharing

If the name is not correct, you won't be able to find it by clicking on the link.

Instead, go to the organization page: <https://github.com/ucsd-cse-spis-2016>, type "practice-" in the search box,
and look through to see if you can find the repo.  They may have used a capital letter, or something.

In that case, the easiest thing to do for now is just correct the name yourself.  Until after lab03, we aren't going to
get picky about names---we'll just fix them for them.

# Does the repo contain a README.md with some text

Next, read the text and see if it makes sense.  See if they had any formatting issues, etc.

Add something to the feedback repo to let them know you read their text.

# Do they have a selfie in the repo

They were supposed to put a selfie in the repo (picture of themselves.)

There is a naming convention they were supposed to follow (see the lab instructions here: [lab00](/lab/lab00)

If they have one, can you clearly read their name?  We are going to use these later in SPIS, so we want to be sure that the names are visible.

If the name isn't visible, or the picture is missing, or the name is wrong, provide some feedback on what is not according to instructions, and also offer to be of help to them in going back to fix the problem.
