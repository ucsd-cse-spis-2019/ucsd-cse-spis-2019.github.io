Go to the ucsd-cse-spis-2018 organization on github.com and navigate to each pair's repo for lab 3. The repo should be named spis18-lab03-Name-Name

Open each of the warmup files.  These were completed individually.  Run the `drawA` (or whatever letter) in idle and make sure it draws a letter.  Make sure it respects the turtle parameter (i.e. call it on two different turtles and make sure it moves both).  Then look at their code and make sure its well-structured, with good variable names, etc.  In their individual feedback repos give them some feedback on the individual section.  Comment on any creativity they used in creating their letters.

Then open their `lab3Letters_pair.py` file.  You do not need to run it.  Look for:
 * Did they answer the three questions at the top of the file?
     1. What is the “anonymous turtle”?
     2. In the code below, what is the difference between turtle and Turtle()
     ```python
     myTurtle = turtle.Turtle() 
     drawPicture(myTurtle)
     ```
      3. Imagine that I have a turtle in a variable named myTurtle. What line of code will change that turtle’s y-position to 100?
    If they got any answers incorrect or if their answers are missing, provide feedback.  If they answered the questions correctly, give them a positive encouragement.
  * Does their letter function properly use the size parameter?
  * Does their code use good style.
Provide feedback on the above in their pair feedback repository.

Finally, open their `irma.py` file and run it.  Does it run correctly?  Then look at their code.  Make sure they are using good format and style and a simple, clean approach.  Do they have proper commenting and variable names?  Commenting on every line is not necessary, but make sure they have at least a few.  If they have done anything overly complicated or in an improper way, comment on how they can improve their code.  If a helper method would be appropriate, suggest it.  This is your opportunity to help them become better programmers!  Leave this feedback in their pair feedback repo.
