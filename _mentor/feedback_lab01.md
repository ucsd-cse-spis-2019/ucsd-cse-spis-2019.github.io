Please refer to the solutions for solving the empty room and the maze in the GitHub repo https://github.com/ucsd-cse-spis-2019/lab01-solutions

For both the empty room and maze copy the student's solution code into the [Picobot simulator](https://www.cs.hmc.edu/picobot/) and try to run it.

If the student's solution works then include a comment to the effect "Great job on completing the empty room or maze!".
If their code doesn't execute correctly, provide some feedback based on the error messages given by the simulator and ask them to revise and resubmit their code.

Check to see if they have descibed what their states mean. If they haven't described their states, put in a comment that says:
"Please include comments that mentions what each state means and resubmit"
Don't try to infer what their states mean until they resubmit.

Continue looking through the rest of their code even if you asked the student to resubmit.
Check the number of states and number of rules used for the empty room and maze.
If you find that they are using significantly more states or rules than the reference solution, include one or two suggestions on how they might improve their code. So, say something to the effect "Your code is correct, but it is possible to use fewer states and rules. Please try to use fewer states and rules, and resumbit. " Look at the solutions for the "nomimal number of states and rules".  Mention that trying to write the code with fewer states is a good cerebral exercise that we would like them to engage in, which is the reason we are asking for them to try again and resubmit.

Feel free to give more concrete suggestions if it is apparent to you.

If they have attempted the challenge part run it. If it runs correctly include a encouraging comment acknowledging their achievement.

You don't have to grade the written part of the lab.
